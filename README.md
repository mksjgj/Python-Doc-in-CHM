# Python 3.12.x Core Reference and Examples

* This CHM package is a comprehensive learning and reference handbook for Python programming language. 
* This handbook is based on the Python official documentation, and integrates many excellent third-party free resources such as "A Byte of Python" and "Awesome-Python". 
* The author of this handbook, a Python developer, has restructured these materials following a programmer's mindset, compiling a detailed table of contents and lots of quick-reference tables. 
* Like all software products, this handbook will continue to evolve and improve, and I hope it will become a must-have desk reference and work companion for all Python programmers. 
* This handbook is completely free of charge, and I am not responsible for the correctness of all its contents. 

* This handbook is published in CHM format, because CHM is really easy to use and sufficient, and the others like EPubs and PDFs are all younger brothers. Moreover, Python no longer provides CHM format documents from 3.11 onwards, this handbook can be regarded as filling the "international gap" 
* This handbook is currently available in Chinese and English, please contact the author if you need other language versions 
* This handbook is mainly generated by a Python program called PyCRE, the previous version is open source, it is troublesome, and it is no longer actively open source since 1.10, if you are interested in this program, please contact me 
* This manual was previously called "Enhanced Python 3.?.? Official Documentation in CHM Format", and since 1.10 it has been under its current name
